# Wireframing
Wifeframes present visual or graphical representation of a project. In other words the skeletal sketch or framework detailing the layout and structure of a website or app.
## Key Elements of Wireframing
- Layout: it refers to the arrangments of elements of the website or app
- Navigation: it explains how users will move through the website or app
- Content Placement: it explains the positioning of items such as text, images, links
- Functionality: Establishes core functionalities and interactions
## Types of Wireframes
- Low-fidelity wireframes capture very basic structure of a wireframe. Usually not refined. It is used in the innitial stage of prototyping.
- On the otherhand high-fidelity wireframes contain very refined elements or contents. These may include, the colours, style and formating of text and images. It is used during advanced stages of prototyping. In some instances, the high-fidelity wireframes become the prototypes.
## Wireframing Tools
- Figma is the most popular wireframing tool used globally. It is simple and easy to use. Figma is a web app hence all files are hosted on the cloud and you never bother to lose your files.
- Adobe Indesign: This is another powerful tool that can be used to create wireframes
- Canva: This is yet another powerful tool that can be used to develop wireframes. It is a web app and can store your files on the cloud.
## Benefits of Wireframing
- Clarifies ideas and concepts: this clears ambiguity and misunderstandings
- Faciliate Communication: allows for effective dialogue between technical and non technical stakeholders
- Identifies usability issues: establishes user relationships and activities
- Saves Time and Resources: prevents significant modifications in advance stages
- Provides a Clear layout and structure: provides a visual for assessment
- Enables easy modifications: easy techniques to capture changes
- Guides the design process: serves as the foundation for future designs and development
- Focuses on functionality and user experience: allows for better understanding of user expectations and experience
## Wireframe in Practice
- During my Professional Foundation learning days, my team developed a wireframe for the development of an E-commerce website for farmers to sell their produce. In review of the wireframe with farmers, one key usability issue that we encountered was authentication. Apparently users preferred OTP authentication whereas the development team innitially thought this feature would have been too technical for the peasant farmer to understand.
- Wireframes provide the visual mockup of the project capturing the key elements that will enhance the user experience.
